# TestRail.NUnit.Integration

The goal of this project is to provide automation capabilities to functional testing using NUnit as the testing framework. This project enables you to add the results of tests executed in NUnit to TestRail. If you aren't using TestRail as your Test Case Management tool, this article will not be beneficial.
